# JSGameReimagined

Really basic 2D game, developed with Unreal Engine 5, mostly to act as a comparison to a similar project I have done with JS(https://github.com/StefanosNtouvlis/FIGHTING-GAME)
Has a really basic moveset, as well as, a few collisions. Plus the great background and character sprite.
